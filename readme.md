**Methods**

To model the E-Commerce database, various methods were employed:

- **Requirement Analysis**: System requirements were thoroughly analyzed to identify key entities and their relationships. This involved defining entities such as Customers, Products, Orders, Payments, and Deliveries.
- **Entity Definition and Attribute Specification**: Entities were defined, along with their respective attributes. Attributes such as name, email, address, and product details were determined for each entity.
- **Establishment of Relationships**: Relationships between entities were established, such as the relationship between Customers and Orders, Orders and Products, and Orders and Payments.
- **Normalization of the Database**: The database was normalized to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity, adhering to standard normalization principles.

**Results**

The results of modeling the E-Commerce database include:

- **Complete Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**: An ER diagram was created, illustrating all entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
- **SQL Script Generation**: SQL scripts were generated using MySQL Workbench to create the necessary tables in the E-Commerce database.
- **Database Structure**: A structured database schema was developed that meets the requirements of the e-commerce platform, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of customer, product, order, payment, and delivery information.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, database modeling is a crucial step in the development of an e-commerce platform. Through careful analysis and design, the E-Commerce database was successfully modeled to meet the requirements of the system. By adhering to standard normalization principles and establishing appropriate relationships between entities, the database ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient data management.

**Case Study: Online Retail Store**

To exemplify the practical application of the E-Commerce database modeling, consider a case study of an online retail store.

In this system, customers can browse through a variety of products, add them to their cart, and place orders for purchase. The database stores information about customers, products, orders, payments, and deliveries, enabling seamless order processing and efficient management of the online store. Through effective database modeling, the online retail store can provide a user-friendly shopping experience while maintaining data accuracy and reliability.
